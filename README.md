semester project "Sudoku game"

Input can be made by clicking on a blank square on the Sudoku board, highlighting it, and then pressing the number keys.
Once all the blank squares are filled, the correct or incorrect answer is indicated.

The numbers written in black are the initial values, the numbers in blue are the numbers you entered.
When an answer is shown, numbers in red indicate where the answer was different from the correct answer.
